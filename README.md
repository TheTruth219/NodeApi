This is an API, WebApp, and CLI built with zero dependencies in Node. It allows you to create an account, and choose up to 5 sites to recieve automated SMS alerts via Twilio upon site status changes.

The CLI allows you to look at the number of users and stats associated as well as the core resources being consumed.

****Important**** 
This uses versions lower than 10, as some of the methods have since been depricated.
